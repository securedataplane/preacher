This test is designed to verify that an ONOS cluster behaves correctly using
all the same verifications as the other HA tests. There is no control plane
failures in this test. This is so that it is easier to find the cause of bugs
discovered through the HA suite.

The gerneral structure for the test:
- Startup
- Assign switches
- Verify ONOS state and functionality
    - Device mastership
    - Intents
    - Leadership election
    - Distributed Primitives
- Wait 60 seconds
- Verify ONOS state and functionality
- Dataplane failures
    - link down and up
    - switch down and up
