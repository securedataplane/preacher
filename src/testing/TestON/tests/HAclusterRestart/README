This test is designed to verify that an ONOS cluster behaves correctly when all
ONOS nodes die. We will kill the entire ONOS cluster and verify correct
behavior as the cluster restarts.

The gerneral structure for the test:
- Startup
- Assign switches
- Verify ONOS state and functionality
    - Device mastership
    - Intents
    - Leadership election
    - Distributed Primitives
- Kill ONOS nodes
- Restart ONOS nodes
- Verify ONOS state and functionality
- Dataplane failures
    - link down and up
    - switch down and up
