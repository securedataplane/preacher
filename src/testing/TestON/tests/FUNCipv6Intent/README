Summary:
        This test suite consist of basic intent IPv6 functionality testing.
        The following is an overview of how point-to-point intents are being tested.
        Steps:
            - Discover IPv6 hosts with ICMP6 ping
            - Add point intents
            - Check intents
            - Verify flows
            - ICMP6 ping of all hosts
            - Reroute
                - Link down
                - Verify flows
                - Check topology
                - Ping hosts
                - Link up
                - Verify flows
                - Check topology
                - Ping hosts
            - Verify intents with VLAN-id
            - Remove intents
        This test suite includes testing of different types of intents such as
        host, point, single-to-multi and multi-to-single ( More intent types to
        add later ). The same steps above is being performed to other type of
        intents.

Required:
        This test requires Mininet topology file newFuncIntent.py that is in the
        Dependency folder. You should run the topology file to check for any
        missing packages. The mininet topology file has different type of hosts
        including VLAN hosts. Therefore you need to install VLAN module to build
        the topology correctly.

VLAN configuration:
        Execute command:
            $ sudo apt-get install vlan
        Configuration:
            $ sudo modprobe 8021q
        NOTE:To make this configuration permanent
            $ sudo su -c 'echo "8021q" >> /etc/modules'
