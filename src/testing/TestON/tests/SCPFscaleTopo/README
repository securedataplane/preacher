Summary:
        This is a performance test suite that is designed to test
        large topologies. It also contains a failure case that brings
        down an onos controller to see if the neighboring controllers
        pick up the rest of the devices.
NOTE:
        This test does not scale onos controllers. The number of
        controllers is fixed at 3.
