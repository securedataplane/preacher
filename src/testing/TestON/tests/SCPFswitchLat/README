SWITCH LATENCY

Summary: This is a performance test suite to measure the time it takes ONOS
        to recognize a switch going up and down.

Pre-requisites: To run out-of-the box this test requires 7 NODES.
    OC1->OC7 must be set before initiating the test. Passwordless login
    must be set from TestStation "admin" root user. The 7 NODES must have
    their clocks synced to TestStation via ptpd and be accurate to the
    millisecond. You will also need the Wireshark disector to see openflow packets.

*** If you wish to run this test with less than 7 nodes the following
    alterations must be made:

NOTE: Only scale sizes 1,3,5 and 7 will be functional

Modifying .params file:
-- Remove any values in the comma separated list in the
    <scale> tag that are above your desired cluster size.

-- Remove one instance of “1,2” from the <testcases> tag for each
    value you removed from <scale> (case 1 and 2 are each called once
    for each scale value)

-- Change the value in the <max> tag to your desired scale size (1,3,5)

Modifying .topo file:
-- Change the <ONOSbench/COMPONENTS/nodes> tag to your
    desired scale size

-- Remove all unneeded <ONOS#cli> tags and their contents
